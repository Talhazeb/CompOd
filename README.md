# CompOd

Compod is a web application that uses a combination of Whisper AI and a Flask backend to transcribe live voice to text. The application has a React frontend and two servers for the backend: one for processing the voice to text model and the other for handling login, signup, the medical catalog, and summarization.

Setup
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Talhazeb/CompOd.git
2. Navigate to the directory: cd Compod
3. Install the dependencies for the backend: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the backend servers:
5. For the voice to text processing server: python app.py
6. For the login, signup, medical catalog, and summarization server: python app2.py
7. Install the dependencies for the frontend: npm install
8. Run the frontend: npm start

Usage
To use Compod, follow the steps above to set up the application and start the servers. Once the frontend is running, you can use the application by logging in or creating an account. From there, you can access the medical catalog and use the live voice to text transcription feature by clicking on the appropriate buttons.
